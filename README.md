# K첫zuDB: Benchmark study

[K첫zu](https://kuzudb.com/) is an in-process (embedded) graph database management system (GDBMS) built for query speed and scalability. It is written in C++, optimized for handling complex join-heavy analytical workloads on very large graph databases, and is under active development. The goal of the code shown in this repo is as follows:

* Generate an artificial dataset that can be used to build an artificial social network graph
* Ingest the data into K첫zu
* Run a set of queries in Cypher on the data to benchmark the performance of K첫zu
* Study the ingestion and query times in comparison with Neo4j, and optimize where possible

Python is used as the intermediary between the source data and the DB.

## Setup

Activate a Python virtual environment and install the dependencies as follows.

```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data

An artificial social network dataset is used, generated via the [Faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/) Python library.

### Nodes: Persons

First, fake male and female profile information is generated for the number of people required to be in the network.

```sh
$ cd data
# Create a dataset of 1000 fake profiles for men and women with a 50-50 split by gender
$ python create_persons.py -n 1000
```

The CSV file generated contains a header and fake data as shown below.


id|name|gender|birthday|age|isMarried
---|---|---|---|---|---
1|Natasha Evans|female|1985-08-31|37|true
2|Gregory Smith|male|1985-11-30|37|false


The data in each column is separated by the `|` symbol to make it explicit what the column boundaries are (especially when the data itself contains commas).

### Nodes: Locations

To generate a list of cities that people live in, we use the [world cities dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/juanmah/world-cities?resource=download) from Kaggle. This is an accurate and up-to-date database of the world's cities and towns, including lat/long and population information of ~44k cities all over the world.

To make this dataset simpler and more realistic, we only consider cities from the following three countries: `US`, `UK` and `CA`. 

```sh
$ python create_locations.py

Wrote 7117 cities to CSV
Wrote 273 states to CSV
Wrote 3 countries to CSV
```

Three CSV files are generated accordingly for cities, states and the specified countries. Latitude, longitude and population are the additional metadata fields for each city.

#### `cities.csv`

id|city|state|country|lat|lng|population
---|---|---|---|---|---|---
1|Airdrie|Alberta|Canada|51.2917|-114.0144|61581
2|Beaumont|Alberta|Canada|53.3572|-113.4147|17396

#### `states.csv`

id|state|country
---|---|---
1|Alberta|Canada
2|British Columbia|Canada
3|Manitoba|Canada

#### `countries.csv`

id|country
---|---
1|Canada
2|United Kingdom
3|United States

### Nodes: Interests

A static list of interests/hobbies that a person could have is included in `raw/interests.csv`. This is cleaned up and formatted as required by the data generator script.

```sh
$ python create_interests.py
```

This generates data as shown below.

id|interest
--- | ---
1|Anime
2|Art & Painting
3|Biking

### Edges: Person-person

Edges are generated between people in a similar way to the way we might imagine social networks. A `Person` follows another `Person`, with the direction of the edge signifying something meaningful.
