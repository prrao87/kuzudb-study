# Kùzu graph

This section describes how to build and query a graph of the social network data in KùzuDB. It uses Kùzu's [client API](https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu) to perform the ingestion and querying.

## Setup

Because Kùzu is an embedded graph database, the database is tightly coupled with the application layer -- there is no server to set up and run. Simply `pip install kuzu` and you're good to go!

## Build graph

The script `build_graph.py` contains the necessary methods to connect to the KùzuDB DB and ingest the data from the CSV files, in batches for large amounts of data.

```sh
python build_graph.py --batch_size 50000
```

### Ingestion performance

The numbers shown below are for when we ingest 100K person nodes, ~10K location nodes and ~2.4M edges into the graph.

As expected, the nodes load much faster than the edges, since there are many more edges than nodes. The run times for ingesting nodes and edges are output to the console.

```
Nodes loaded in 0.0872s
Edges loaded in 2.0920s
```

> 💡 Ingesting the nodes/edges via the CSV bulk loader in KùzuDB takes under 3 seconds 🔥, as opposed to ~65 seconds for Neo4j. The timing shown is on an M2 Macbook Pro with 16 GB of RAM.

## Query graph

To verify that the graph was built correctly, the script `query.py` contains a few example queries that can be run against the DB, generating some simple statistics.

```sh
python query.py
```

The following questions are asked of the graph:

* **Query 1**: Who are the top 3 most-followed persons?
* **Query 2**: In which city does the most-followed person live?
* **Query 3**: What are the top 5 cities with the lowest average age of persons?
* **Query 4**: How many persons between ages 30-40 are there in each country?

## To do

- [ ] Fix and optimize queries 2-4 (currently not working)

#### Output

```
Query 1 completed in 0.145473s

Query 1:
 
        MATCH (follower:Person)-[:Follows]->(person:Person)
        RETURN person.id AS personID, person.name AS name, count(follower) AS numFollowers
        ORDER BY numFollowers DESC LIMIT 3
    
Top 3 most-followed persons:
shape: (3, 3)
┌──────────┬────────────────┬──────────────┐
│ personID ┆ name           ┆ numFollowers │
│ ---      ┆ ---            ┆ ---          │
│ i64      ┆ str            ┆ i64          │
╞══════════╪════════════════╪══════════════╡
│ 85723    ┆ Rachel Cooper  ┆ 4998         │
│ 68753    ┆ Claudia Booker ┆ 4985         │
│ 54696    ┆ Brian Burgess  ┆ 4976         │
└──────────┴────────────────┴──────────────┘
Queries completed in 0.2517s
```

As can be seen, the results are identical to those obtained from Neo4j.

### Query performance

The numbers shown below are for when we ingest 100K person nodes, ~10K location nodes and ~2.4M edges into the graph. Query times for simple aggregation and path finding are relatively low. More advanced queries involving variable length paths will be studied later.

Summary of run times:

* Query 1: `0.145473s`
* Query 2: TBD
* Query 3: TBD
* Query 4: TBD

> 💡 Query 1 takes the longest to run -- around 150 ms. The timing shown is for queries run on an M2 Macbook Pro with 16 GB of RAM.
